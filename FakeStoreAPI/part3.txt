Question:Â What are the key things you would consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it 
is secure and reliable?

Answer:
Things to consider when creating/consuming an API to ensure that it 
is secure and reliable are-
1. Implement authentication mechanisms like OAuth, JWT, or API keys to ensure only authorized users can 
   access the API and its resources.
2. Encrypt sensitive data, such as passwords, using strong encryption algorithms and secure protocols like HTTPS.
3. Use role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access based on user roles.
4. Enforce HTTPS to secure data in transit and avoid exposing sensitive information.
5. Regularly conduct security audits and vulnerability assessments to identify and address potential threats.
6. Implement error handling that avoids exposing sensitive system details in error messages.
